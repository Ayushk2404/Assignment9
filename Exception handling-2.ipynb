    "    \"\"\"When creating a custom exception in a programming language like Python, it is essential to use the Exception class (or a subclass of it) as the base class for the custom exception. The Exception class serves as the foundation for all built-in exceptions in Python, and using it as the base class for custom exceptions provides several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency with Built-in Exceptions: By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception adheres to the same structure and behavior as built-in exceptions. This consistency makes it easier for developers to understand and handle your custom exception, as they can rely on their existing knowledge of how exceptions work in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Error Handling: Python's exception hierarchy is designed to handle errors gracefully and to allow for structured error handling. By using the Exception class as the base, you ensure that your custom exception can be caught and handled in a standard way using try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear Hierarchy: Custom exceptions can be organized in a hierarchy, just like the built-in exceptions. By subclassing from Exception, you create a clear hierarchy for your custom exceptions, which can help in organizing and managing different types of errors in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customized Error Messages: When you create a custom exception, you can override the __init__ method in your subclass to customize the error message and additional information. By using the Exception class, you can utilize the standard functionality for providing error messages, making it easier for developers to identify the root cause of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust Error Reporting: By using the Exception class, you can leverage the full capabilities of Python's error reporting system, which includes stack traces. This information is valuable for debugging and understanding the sequence of events that led to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interoperability: Since Exception is a part of Python's standard library, it ensures that your custom exception plays well with other libraries, modules, and frameworks that rely on the standard exception hierarchy.\n",

    "\n",
    "3.Use Multiple Except Blocks: When handling multiple exception types, use separate except blocks for each one. This allows you to handle different types of errors differently and maintain better control over the flow of your program.\n",

    "4.Avoid Overusing try-except: Try to keep the code inside the try block minimal, covering only the specific code that could raise an exception. This helps narrow down the scope of the try block and reduces the risk of catching unintended exceptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "6.Log Exceptions: Instead of just printing error messages, use the logging module to log exceptions with appropriate log levels. This helps in debugging and monitoring the application effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Avoid Silent Errors: Avoid catching exceptions without any handling, as it might lead to silent errors that are difficult to detect. At the very least, log the exception to know that an error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Reraise Exceptions: If you catch an exception but cannot handle it adequately, consider re-raising it using raise without any arguments. This allows the exception to propagate up the call stack and be handled elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.Use Custom Exceptions: Define custom exception classes when appropriate. This helps in making your code more readable and allows you to differentiate between different types of exceptions raised by your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.Graceful Degradation: Handle exceptions in a way that gracefully degrades the functionality of the program rather than crashing entirely. Provide useful error messages to users when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.Test Exception Scenarios: Write unit tests that cover exception scenarios to ensure that your code behaves as expected when errors occur.\n",
